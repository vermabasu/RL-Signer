# RL-Signer : Generative Adversarial Model For Online Signature Imitation

### INTRODUCTION:
A novel framework RL- Signer, using generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) for online signature generation.
This repository include implementations of :

 - RL-Signer based on Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning.
 - RNN based Signature generator.
 - ShortestPath World (MDP for routing imitations)

### DATA AVALAIBILITY:
Two online signature datasets are used in this approach, ensuring good intra-user variance.

 - MCYT 
 - Biosecure-ID

 Signatures were captured across sessions on different OEM devices to provide sufficient input diversity. The data includes (X, Y ) coordinates, pressure values, and timestamps. Coordinates with zero pressure, indi- cating no pen contact, were removed. To address redundancy caused by the e-padsâ€™ high 200Hz sampling frequency, repet- itive captures were removed during data preparation.


### REQUIREMENTS:
